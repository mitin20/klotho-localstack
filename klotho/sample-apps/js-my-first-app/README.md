# My First App

This project is intended to be used along with our [Your First Klotho App](https://klo.dev/docs/tutorials/your_first_klotho_app). The purpose of this project is to show how you can quickly create a cloud-ready REST API with data persistence.

## Run the app locally

run the terminal commands:
```shell
npm install
node index.js
> App listening locally on: 3000
```
